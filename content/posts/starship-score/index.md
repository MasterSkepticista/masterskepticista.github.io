The chopstick booster catch was an unprecendented leap for humanity as a whole. I found myself looping over the recap that the SpaceX team published soon after. Of course I fell in love with the background score. It has become a ritual to hear it ever so often. Here is my running attempt at finding the original tracks.

## Starship \| Fifth Flight Test

Pieces of the main track are scattered all over the video. The sonic boom debut at 1:55 is both visually and _sonically_ prominent. It is such a bold way of signalling the booster's arrival.

## Starship \| Sixth Flight Test

* Main track: [Zero Sum, Factor One](https://lensdistortions.com/music/?an=9864)
* Outro (starts at 1:15 in the video): [Variables, Factor One](https://lensdistortions.com/music/?an=9885&start_at=0.786).

10 seconds in, and we know this flight test is focused on the **[pace of iteration](/posts/the-algorithm/#4-accelerate-cycle-time)**. Sad that we didn't get to see a chopstick booster catch this time. Another goal of this flight test was to re-light the Starship engine in space. The overlap of the re-light and the beat of the background score starting 0:55 couldn't be better...

The outro puts a clear emphasis on turning around to **Flight 7**. I think this outro has been the best of all Starship Flight Test recaps so far (please see those sonic booms mingling in the white smoke during the static fire before you disagree).

## Starship \| Seventh Flight Test

It is a tough job to keep the admirers hooked when you have had 6 launch recaps happening every few months already. The first time I watched this recap I was not impressed - the background score felt muted and secondary. It didn't have to be, because this was the first successful booster catch after **Flight 5** and the outro from **Flight 6** had raised my expectations.

What was the catch then? I think the visuals in this recap do the job of hooking you in. Switch to 4K60 and skip to 0:38. Now watch it a few times, and feel the background score starting to grow on you.

There is a sonic boom debut at 1:57, which is where you may find notes in the background score most appealing. To me, the notes throughout this track beam a light of courage, hope, and consistency.

Oh, and then more sonic booms at 2:46.
