I am a Computer Science graduate student at the University of Massachusetts - Amherst. I was previously affiliated with Intel, building [OpenFL](https://github.com/securefederatedai/openfl) (a Linux Foundation project) and Intel Tiber [Secure Federated AI](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/software/federated-ai.html) - a Federated Learning Service to train models on private, decentralized data with confidentiality.
<!-- 
Previously, I built on-device learning algorithms for edge machine learning applications. In 2022, my team deployed the [first](https://health.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/health-it/aster-dm-intel-carpl-collaborate-for-secure-federated-learning-platform/92599071) TEE-based secure federated learning stack in India. -->
